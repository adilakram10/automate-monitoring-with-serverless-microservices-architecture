To identify log entries where the response time of a endpoint exceeding 3 seconds, the following cloudwatch query can be used:

```
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /response time for endpoint exceeding/
| parse @message 'High response time for /api/data: * (\\d+) ms' as responseTime
| filter responseTime > 3000
| sort @timestamp desc
```

This query filters log entries where the response time of the endpoint exceeds 3 seconds (3000 milliseconds), and then groups the results by 10-minute intervals. The `stats count()` function counts the number of log entries in each interval, and the `sort count desc` function sorts the results in descending order by count.

```
fields @timestamp, responseTime
| filter responseTime > 3000
| stats count() as count by bin(10m)\
| sort count desc
```

```
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /response time for the endpoint/
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 4
```
